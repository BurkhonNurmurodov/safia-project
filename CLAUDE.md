# Safia Dashboard — project instructions

## UI element templates (mandatory)

Every recurring element type has exactly ONE template component in
`frontend/src/components/ui/`. When building any new feature, use these
templates — never hand-roll a new variant of an element type that already
has one. If a template lacks a feature, extend it with a prop; do not fork
or copy-paste its markup into a page.

| Element type | Template | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| Dropdown / select | `StyledSelect.jsx` | Never a native `<select>`. Compact toolbars: `triggerClassName="px-2.5 py-1.5 text-xs"`. |
| Date picker (range or single) | `DateRangePicker.jsx` | Single date → `single` prop. Never a bare `<input type="date">`. |
| "‹ day ›" stepper on daily pages | `DayStepper.jsx` | `max={null}` to allow future dates. |
| Dialog / form modal | `Modal.jsx` | Backdrop `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)` + Telegram safe-top; rounded-2xl card; header = title (+subtitle/icon) + X close; body scrolls; footer right-aligned. |
| Modal footer buttons | `Button.jsx` inside `Modal footer` | Order: cancel (`variant="secondary"`) on the LEFT, primary action on the RIGHT. |
| Confirm ("are you sure") dialog | `ConfirmDialog.jsx` | `tone="danger"` for deletions (red chip + red confirm), default warning (amber chip + brand confirm). Sits above form modals (z 100). Carries `role=dialog`, a focus trap, Escape-to-cancel and initial focus on the SAFE button. `error` renders the failure INSIDE the dialog — a mutation that fails must leave the dialog standing with the reason on it, never close and fire `alert()`. `challenge` (+ `challengeLabel`) demands the operator retype a string before confirm enables: use it for anything no undo can reach (full-DB restore → `RESTORE`, whole-day attendance wipe → the date). `cancelLabel` defaults to `common.cancel`. |
| Transient action feedback (saved / sent / failed) | `Toast.jsx` | `<Toast>` controlled, or `useToast()` for the state+timer. Tones `success/error/warning/info`; errors persist until dismissed (you cannot re-read a toast that vanished). Portals to `document.body`, offsets by `--tg-safe-top`/`--tg-safe-bottom`, carries `role=status`. `position="bottom"` for dense editing surfaces. **NEVER `window.alert/confirm/prompt` — Telegram's iOS WebView silently suppresses them, so a failure becomes invisible on the primary device.** Never paste a fixed green `<div>`; never morph a Save button into its own status message. |
| Comment thread on a record | `CommentsModal.jsx` (`CommentsModal` + `CommentsButton`) | THE chat thread. Point it at a resource exposing the four standard endpoints — `GET/POST {endpoint}`, `PUT/DELETE {endpoint}/{id}` — via `endpoint` + `queryKey` + `refreshKeys` (the list keys whose `comment_count` badge must re-count); `title`/`subtitle` name the record. Ownership is NEVER re-derived on the client: the backend serves `is_own` per message, because a message belongs to the authoring PROFILE and one account may hold several. `CommentsButton` is the table-cell trigger (count badge, gold once non-empty) — a Comments column on the table for `sm+`, the same button on the mobile card's footer row. A failed write raises an error toast; the thread scrolls to the newest message. Used by `/tasks` and `/concerns`. |
| File upload | `UploadDropzone.jsx` (`UploadDropzone` + `FileStateList` + `useFileStates`) | One drag-drop model for every upload surface. Rejected files always render (a silent rejection reads as success); rows are keyed by generated id, not filename; result detail wraps on its own line; the bar carries progressbar ARIA; 100% flips to "processing" because parsing happens after transfer. `renderExtra(state)` is the seam for per-endpoint result detail — use it instead of forking the row markup. |
| Button | `Button.jsx` | Variants `primary/secondary/danger/ghost/success`, sizes `sm/md/lg`; `loading` shows the spinner. `tint` gives the soft-tinted form (12% bg + coloured border/label) — **THE form for table-row actions**. Never hand-roll a chip with inline rgba + `onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave`: mouse events never fire on touch, so a destructive action stays stuck in its neutral rest state on a phone. Forwards refs. |
| Segmented toggle + page view-tabs (min/hrs, P·A·P−A, view/mode switch, theme, Production/Staff tabs) | `SegmentedToggle.jsx` | Recessed-track pill: a `bg-inner` track (`rounded-xl`, `p-[3px]` inset, subtle `border`, no dividers) holding segments — the selected one is a brand-gold (`--brand`) pill with a white label, the rest transparent with muted `text-3`. This is ALSO the page-level "view tabs" template (Production view switch, Staff Workers/Requests) — same component, don't hand-roll a padded tab group. Outer height stays `size="md"` (default, 38px = `Button` lg / toolbar baseline) or `"sm"` (30px = `Button` md) so it aligns in toolbars. `options` = `[value,label]` tuples or `{value,label,title}` objects (label may be a node/icon). **THE template for EVERY toggle on the platform — any set of 2+ mutually-exclusive options (mode / view / period / type / status / tab / shift / theme switch), current and future. Never hand-roll a button group or padded tab bar; extend this with a prop if it lacks something.** For option sets that overflow on phones use the `scrollable` prop — NOT your own `overflow-x-auto` wrapper: a bare wrapper hides the scrollbar without replacing the affordance and leaves the selected segment off-screen, at which point nothing looks selected and the user cannot tell where they are. `scrollable` scrolls the active segment into view and adds edge fades. `asTabs` adds tablist/tab roles, `aria-selected` and arrow-key navigation when the toggle switches VIEWS. |
| Form label + control | `FormField.jsx` | Uppercase 11px label, red `*` when `required`. `hint` puts consequential copy ("this resets manual edits", "re-uploading replaces the day") UNDER the control at 11px/`--text-3` — never at `--text-4`, where the eye skips exactly the text that matters most. `error` attaches a validation message to the field that caused it instead of dumping one paragraph below every field. |
| Text field that exists in all 4 languages | `LangTextInput.jsx` | Never stack one input per language. A `SegmentedToggle` of language tabs (uz · uz_cyrl · ru · en, **ru open by default**) over ONE input for the selected tab. Every language is optional; a blank tab shows the Russian text as its PLACEHOLDER (previewed, never saved) plus the `ui.langInput.ruFallback` hint, because Russian is what the UI falls back to. Tabs stay plain — no filled/empty markers. `placeholderFn(lang)` previews something computed (e.g. a transliteration) instead of the Russian text; `action` puts a per-tab button beside the input — use these to ADOPT the template rather than forking it into stacked inputs. |
| Search box | `SearchInput.jsx` | Magnifier icon + clear-X built in. |
| Generic data table | `DataTable.jsx` (`TableCard` + `Th` + `SortIcon` + `SectionHead`) | Styled after the Production «Позиции» table: card + SectionHead (right slot = row count), toolbar row (search/filters/actions), sticky bg-inner sortable headers, vertical column separators, `px-3 py-2` cells, baked row borders + hover. Loading = skeleton rows in tbody; empty = one centered colSpan row. Unique visualisation tables (fleet heatmap, comparison/difference, stat matrices) are exempt. |
| Card/section header | `SectionHead` from `DataTable.jsx` | Icon + uppercase title + right slot; never redefine locally. |
| Table pager | `Pagination.jsx` | For registers too long to dump into the DOM (thousands of rows). Sits directly under the `TableCard`: "x–y of N" left, windowed page buttons right, built from `Button`. Renders nothing for a single page. |
| Column show/hide + reorder | `ColumnsPicker.jsx` | 38px `Columns3` icon trigger on the toolbar's RIGHT edge (`className="ml-auto"`, hidden-count badge) + portaled panel listing every column IN TABLE ORDER — hidden ones stay dimmed in place (eye-off), never regrouped to the bottom. Hide all/Show all links; drag-to-reorder only arms via the panel's reorder button. Controlled: `columns [{key,label,locked}]`, `order`, `hidden`, `onChange({order,hidden})`. Persist via `/api/ui-prefs/{key}` (per-profile JSON blobs, `UiPref` model); reconcile saved keys against the current column catalog and keep identity columns `locked`. `t("cols.*")` keys exist in all 4 langs. Excel exports of a picker-equipped table must mirror it exactly — send the visible keys in on-screen order (`columns`) with the row-id `order`, backend formats keyed per column. (Exception: the Позиции export deliberately emits the fixed brigadir «ABC форма» formula workbook instead of a picker mirror — don't revert it. It reproduces the manual form cell-for-cell: totals row 1, headers row 2, positions row 3+, team block M:W, indicators X:Y, staffing Z:AA; only Трудоемкость/Команда/Факт/ПЛАН/Штатка and the reconciliation counts are values, everything else is a live formula so the brigadir's edits recalculate. Superseded the older «загрузка» two-shift layout.) See the Production «Позиции» table for the reference wiring (cells rendered by a per-key switch so hide/reorder is free). |
| Factory (plant) switcher | `useFactorySection()` from `FactorySelect.jsx` | THE plant switcher — a `FilterPanel` SECTION, first in every factory-aware page's section list (plant → shift → supervisor → …), never a standalone control on the bar. (The standalone `FactorySelect` dropdown and the `FactoryTabs` strip before it are both retired from page toolbars: each cost a permanent toolbar cell on a phone-first platform for a value most users never change.) «All factories» is the FIRST option. Returns `null` when fewer than two factories exist; a locked viewer (supervisor/leader) gets a `static` section — an inert chip naming their plant, never a one-option control. The `FactorySelect` component itself survives only for non-toolbar surfaces (admin forms). |
| Pressable cell reference | `CellLink.jsx` | THE way a production cell rendered as CONTENT (table cell, card, chip) opens its page `/cells/:id` — dotted-underline affordance via the `.cell-link` rule in `index.css`. `id` = cells.id; without one it renders inert text (never a dead link). Clicks stop propagation, so it nests in clickable rows. FILTER controls listing cells never navigate. Don't put it inside another `<button>` (IdleCell accordion / AttendanceUpload expander stay unlinked on purpose — nested-interactive + they hold unsaved drafts). `/cells/:id` (`CellDetails.jsx`) is auth-only like `/profile`; its edit modal is the shared `CellFormModal.jsx` (ONE form with the `/cells` register). |
| Empty-data placeholder | `EmptyState.jsx` | For page/section level. Table "no match" rows stay plain muted text. |
| Full-screen "you can't see this page" state | `ErrorScreen.jsx` | THE template for 404, no-access, a crash, offline, and every blocked auth status (`AuthGate`'s screens, `NoAccess`, `ErrorBoundary` all render through it). Shape: tinted icon chip → status `code` → `title` → ONE sentence → ONE primary `action` → `secondary` escape hatch → `detail` collapsed. Tones are the status palette: `danger` broke, `warning` blocked-but-fixable, `neutral` slate just-not-there (404/403), `brand` an invitation (register) — never a raw emoji as the lead visual, which is what all eight hand-rolled copies used to do. Takes focus on the primary action at mount and pads for Telegram safe areas. `inline` drops the viewport wrapper for a screen rendered INSIDE `Layout` (the 404 keeps the sidebar, so the nav is itself an escape hatch). |
| Loading | `Skeleton.jsx` blocks for page/section data loads; `Loader2` spinner inside buttons for actions | Never bare `…` / "Загрузка…" text. |

Other UI conventions:

- Modal stacking: base modals z=50 (`Modal` default), nested modals pass `zIndex={60+}`, `ConfirmDialog` defaults to 100.
- Table-toolbar controls share ONE height — 38px, the `FilterPanel` trigger (`px-3 py-2 text-sm` + border). `SearchInput` default and `SegmentedToggle` md are also 38px. `Button` is the exception: md/sm are compact (≈30/26px) for modals & inline actions, so a toolbar action button must use **`size="lg"`** (38px) to line up with the filter/search controls next to it. All `Button` variants carry a border (transparent on borderless ones) so heights line up — don't strip it.
- `FilterPanel` (in `ColumnFilter.jsx`) is THE page/table filter zone. **Every page's scope controls (plant / shift / supervisor / leader / cell / category) live INSIDE it as sections — never as standalone selects stacked above the content.** The page bar is ONE row: the period control (`DateRangePicker compactLabel`, or `DayStepper` on daily pages) inline, then `FilterPanel`, then chips. It adapts to space: on md+ it unfolds into one dropdown per filter while the WHOLE toolbar row fits on a single line, else it collapses to the grouped «Filtrlar» button (below md: bottom sheet). Whenever controls are not visible inline, every ACTIVE section renders as a CHIP beside the trigger — `display` text + per-chip ✕ (`onClear`); chip body re-opens the panel; `static: true` sections are inert chips (locked viewer's plant). Sections: `{ key, icon, label, active, display, render({close}), onClear?, static?, group? }` — `PickFilter` (single-select list, closes on pick), `OptsFilter` (multi), `RngFilter`, or an embedded `SegmentedToggle fill`. `group` (a translated caption) splits the collapsed surfaces into labelled blocks in first-appearance order; use it wherever a page carries both a scope CHAIN and record filters, so ten anonymous rows read as two short lists (Quality: «Kim va qayerda» = plant → shift → brigadir → leader → cell, «Nima bo'ldi» = the register filters). **A cascading level narrows the level below it and SAYS SO**: build each list under the levels above it, pass `PickFilter`'s `note` ("narrowed by «X» · N") so a shortened list is never mistaken for missing data, pass `empty` (a message + a button clearing the parent) for a level narrowed to nothing, and drop a child pick its own list no longer offers when the parent changes — a control naming a value the page cannot show is worse than a reset. See the Quality org chain for the reference wiring. Omit `activeCount`/`anyActive`/`onClearAll` unless overriding — the panel computes them from sections. Keep it a DIRECT child of the toolbar flex row — the fit check measures that row's children (flex-grow spacers count as 0). View switches (tabs) stay OUTSIDE the panel; text search stays an inline `SearchInput`.
- All colors via CSS variables (`var(--bg-card)`, `var(--bg-inner)`, `var(--text-1..4)`, `var(--border)`, `var(--brand)`) — no hardcoded grays/hex for chrome, including on admin pages.
- No raw emojis — lucide icons in soft tint chips (see `ProjectIcon` in `Kaizen.jsx`).
- Status colors are traffic-light: red `#ef4444` / yellow `#eab308` / green `#22c55e`; "not started" is grey `#94a3b8`; brand gold `#C8973F` is an accent, never a status.
- Categorical chart colors (roles, units, products, people, series identities) come from `utils/chartPalette.js` `CATEGORY_COLORS`, assigned generic-first in this exact order: red → green → blue → yellow → orange → purple → teal → pink → … One fixed hue per category, reused across every chart that shows it; «Остальные/Other» folds are `FOLD_COLOR` slate. Brand gold NEVER represents a category (all pages except `/leaders`). Single-metric accents, status palettes, and value-intensity ramps are separate and may keep gold.
- Date-axis line/area charts never show fewer than 7 days — use `utils/chartRange.js`.
- ApexCharts custom tooltips (`tooltip: { custom: … }`) draw their own glassy box, but ApexCharts still wraps them in a themed box → a white halo / extra layer around the tooltip. EVERY such chart MUST carry `apx-bare-tip` on an ancestor to strip that wrapper: `<ReactApexChart className="apx-bare-tip" … />` (react-apexcharts forwards `className` to the container div), or on an existing wrapper div. Default `theme`-only tooltips don't need it. See the `.apx-bare-tip` rule in `index.css`.

## Admin panel structure

`/admin/upload` is a first-class page inside the standard `Layout` (so admins keep
the notifications bell, Settings and profile while doing daily uploads). The
shell is `pages/admin/AdminPanel.jsx`; each destination is a plain component that
renders its own content and **no frame of its own** — no `max-w-*`, no `mx-auto`,
no outer padding. The shell owns one content column, so switching destinations
never moves the frame.

- **`ADMIN_NAV` in `AdminPanel.jsx` is the single source of truth** for order,
  grouping, landing destination and capability filtering. Never introduce a
  second parallel list — the old code kept two, they drifted, and a grantee's
  computed landing tab stopped matching the one displayed first.
- Four groups, ordered by how often they are used and how much they can destroy:
  **Kunlik** (attendance · data · production · cellatt) → **Odamlar va ruxsat**
  (users · profiles · access · permissions · actions) → **Vositalar** (broadcast ·
  ltasks · translations · display) → **Xavfli zona** (cleanup · dbdump). Danger
  items are marked red and stay last; never put a data-destroying tool next to a
  daily one.
- Navigation is a grouped sidebar on `lg+` and a grouped bottom sheet on phones.
  A pill strip is NOT acceptable primary navigation here: at 390px only ~3 of 15
  fit, and an off-screen selection makes the panel look like nothing is selected.
- A destination with unsaved edits calls `useAdminDirty(true)`; the shell
  interposes a confirm before unmounting it. Any new destination holding a local
  draft must do this.
- `?tab=` is two-way (the bot deep-links it) and every destination names itself
  with a title + one-line description (`admin.desc.<id>`), so identity never
  depends on a nav item being visible.
- A destination added by splitting an existing one carries `capKey` pointing at
  the original id, so the split cannot narrow any grantee's access.

## Factory (plant) dimension

The company runs more than one plant. The dimension is attached in **exactly one
place** — `managers.factory_id` — and everything else derives from it: a cell
follows its supervisor, a leader follows their unit, a downtime/quality row
follows the supervisor its name resolves to, a concern follows the unit it was
logged against. Never add a second `factory_id` column; two sources let a cell
claim factory A while the supervisor running it sits in factory B, and there is
no correct way to render that.

- `app/services/factory_scope.py` is THE definition. Endpoints take
  `factory: Optional[int]` and call `scoped_manager_ids(db, payload, factory,
  manager_id)`, which intersects the factory with the caller's existing
  supervisor filter AND enforces the viewer lock. `None` = no narrowing;
  an EMPTY list is a real answer ("no supervisor matches") — always test it with
  `empty_scope()` or the empty factory reads as the whole plant.
- **Supervisors and leaders are locked** to their own plant server-side
  (`resolve_factory` overrides whatever `?factory=` says). Hiding the tab is not
  the mechanism — the query parameter is typeable.
- Factory-aware pages: Overview, Zagruzka, Ojidaniya (`Downtime`), Workers,
  Quality, Concerns. Frontend state is ONE shared value in
  `context/FactoryContext.jsx` (`useFactoryParams` merges it into request
  params, `useFactorySupervisors` scopes a supervisor picker and drops a pick
  that fell out of the plant). Deliberately NOT per-page `usePersistentState`:
  six pages remembering different plants is a contradiction nobody can see.
- Rows that resolve to no supervisor (unmatched Quality names, unassigned units,
  legacy concerns) appear ONLY under «All factories» — visible, never silently
  dropped, never padded onto a plant they may not belong to.
- The switcher is `useFactorySection()` from `components/ui/FactorySelect.jsx` —
  a `FilterPanel` section, first in each page's section list (chip when
  narrowed, inert chip for locked viewers). See the UI-template table.
- Admin: `pages/admin/Factories.jsx` (`admin.factories.manage` capability) owns
  the register, tab order, the ONE global default tab, the «All» tab switch, and
  supervisor assignment.

## Automatic proof verification (shift 1, from 13 Aug 2026)

Leader-checklist proof photos are reviewed by Gemini. Since **2026-08-13** that
review is **automatic and consequential for shift 1**: nobody presses anything,
and a flagged proof costs its task immediately. Everything else — every day
before that date, and shift 2 for good — keeps the original regime, where a flag
is a note and only a human `rejected` moves a number.

- **ONE predicate owns the boundary**: `leader_ai.in_auto_regime(date, shift)`
  (`AUTO_FROM = "2026-08-13"`, `AUTO_SHIFTS = (1,)`), with `_auto_clause()` as
  its SQL twin. Five surfaces read it — the score overlay, discovery, the
  drain's ordering, the report DM and the day-report page. A second spelling of
  "is this automatic" would show a leader a red badge on a day whose score never
  moved. An unmatched unit carries a null shift and is deliberately OUT.
- **Every flag rejects** — `not_proven`, `off_topic`, `no_date`, `date_mismatch`
  **and `unreadable`** (the user's ruling). A technical `error` row is NOT a
  flag and never deducts: a dead Drive permission must not mass-fail a shift.
  Only a human `approved` lifts an automatic rejection; `requeried` does not.
- **`auto_discover()` is the second door into discovery's territory**, and it is
  bounded so it cannot become the bulk auto-trigger the user banned three times:
  shift 1, from one fixed date, sheet layer only. It runs on the leaders-sheet
  **Refresh** and returns `ai_queued` so the press states what it produced.
  `discover()` — the walk of everything ever filed — is still reachable only
  from «Tekshirish», which counts first and asks.
- **The drain walks the automatic regime FIRST and in order**: oldest day →
  leader by leader → task 1..N. Not cosmetic: a day's report DM fires when its
  last task lands, so interleaving leaders would leave every day half-checked
  until the end of the batch.
- **Reports are DMed per finished leader-day** (`services/leader_reports.py`) to
  the unit's brigadir **and** the leader — the leader always, clean days
  included, because points now come off automatically and a deduction somebody
  discovers at the end of the month is how trust in the system dies. Both carry
  a `web_app` button onto `/leaders/report/<uid>`. A day the filing-window rule
  already voided is NOT reported: it scores 0 for a reason that outranks the
  photos, and a "verified 62%" would contradict the register.
- **`leader_day_reports` is the ledger**, keyed by `leader_ai.report_key()`.
  `score_sent` is what makes corrections possible: a later re-review, triage
  ruling or upheld dispute re-sends ONLY when the number actually moved
  (`resend_if_changed`). Completion is a trigger, not the only route —
  `sweep_unreported()` runs every drain and sends reports whose one attempt was
  swallowed (Ghost Mode, a Telegram outage, a restart).
- **The review FLOOR and `AUTO_FROM` are the same day (13 Aug 2026)** and
  should stay that way. The floor sat at 11 Aug, so the activity strip said
  review began on the 11th while every scoring surface said the 13th — two
  start dates for one feature, with nothing on screen saying they answer
  different questions. Moving it is the flag-guarded purge in
  `startup.purge_leader_ai_history`: **bumping the date needs a NEW flag key**,
  or the old "already ran" flag makes the new floor a no-op on every box that
  has booted once. It only ever RAISES the floor, never lowers it, and never
  overrules an admin who moved it from «Tarixni tozalash».
- **Auto-queued work announces itself as a RUN** — `auto_discover` is followed
  by `leader_ai.note_auto_run(...)`, exactly as the bot day-close path already
  did. Queueing invisibly is what made the progress strip unreadable: a
  hand-picked re-check sat at «150 / 150 · 100%» with nine hundred auto-queued
  rows behind it and nothing on screen connecting them. The record is the one
  thing every progress reader reads, so this buys the bar, the ETA, Stop and
  the detail view for free. It refuses to displace a LIVE run, so a re-check
  narrowed to one brigadir is never silently widened by someone's Refresh.
- **A drain pass with work left CHAINS into the next one** after
  `DRAIN_CONTINUE_S` (5s), instead of waiting for the timer. The batch cap
  (`gemini_batch_size`, 40) is invisible to the operator, so pacing the queue by
  stalling 20 minutes between bites looked exactly like the drain giving up at a
  random row. `DRAIN_EVERY_MIN` stays 20 and is now only the FALLBACK for a
  queue nobody kicked — a 5s timer would fire a thread and take two locks around
  the clock to find an empty queue. Never chain on `quota` (a 429 hammered every
  five seconds turns a per-minute limit into a per-day one) or on `aborted`
  (retired model / revoked key — the next pass fails identically). The heartbeat
  stays `running` between chained passes, so the strip does not blink through
  `idle` mid-drain. **Consequence to know: a large queue now finishes far
  faster and reaches the daily Gemini cap sooner.**
- **The two RECURRING passes use a rolling window, not the fixed floor** —
  `auto_window_start()` (`AUTO_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 14`). `AUTO_FROM` never moves, so
  a pass bounded only by it re-reads every automatic day ever filed; both of
  these run on a timer or on a button pressed all day, and would get slower
  every day they worked correctly. Catching up on anything older is a
  deliberate errand — «Tekshirish» with scope «unchecked», over a stated count.
- **`/leaders/report/:uid` is the day report** (`pages/LeaderDayReport.jsx`) —
  **auth-only, row-scoped, not page-gated**, like `/cells/:id`: the brigadir
  being told their unit's score is often somebody nobody granted `/leaders` to,
  and a notification opening onto "no access" is worse than no notification.
  Tasks group by OUTCOME (failures first), never by task number; the score is
  never shown without its `submitted → verified` derivation; an unfinished check
  says so instead of looking final. Photos are 72px thumbnails into a lightbox
  **portaled to `document.body`** (`.page-enter`'s transform would otherwise
  contain a `position:fixed` overlay).
- **Disputes are the way back** (`leader_ai_disputes`): the unit's own brigadir
  objects with a mandatory reason from the report page, admins decide inline in
  Telegram (`approvals.py` kind `leader_dispute` / code `ld`) or on the page.
  `_settle_dispute` is THE decision core for both. Approving writes
  `resolution="approved"` on the verdict — that is what restores the weight —
  and the corrected score re-DMs itself. Authority mirrors the late-day flow and
  is deliberately not grantable.
- **`_auto_clause()` folds a NULL shift with `coalesce`, and that is
  load-bearing.** The drain splits its queue into the clause and its negation;
  under SQL three-valued logic a NULL-shift row dated after `AUTO_FROM`
  satisfies NEITHER (`NOT(TRUE AND NULL)` is NULL), so it would sit `pending`
  forever — no verdict, no error, no retry, invisible to both branches. Any
  future split on this predicate must keep the complement total.
- **Proof photos have TWO doors** (`photo_scope_ok` + `permissions.page_allowed`).
  `/api/leaders/photo` and `/api/leader-tasks/media/{id}` are page-gated for the
  register, but the day report is auth-only by design, so it passes its `uid`
  and the photo is authorised against that report's own row scope — plus a
  check that the report really contains it, or a readable report would become a
  fetcher for any photo on the platform. Page-gating them alone rendered the
  verdicts and 403'd every piece of evidence behind them.
- **A report that can never be sent is PARKED, not skipped**
  (`leader_reports._park`, `score_sent = PARKED`, `sends = 0`). A key leaves the
  sweep's candidate set only when a ledger row exists, so a
  filing-window-voided day — and those accumulate daily — would sit in it
  forever, sort ahead of newer keys and eat the whole per-pass budget until the
  safety net silently stopped working. A park is not a send: if the day is
  later opened, the next pass sends its FIRST report, not a correction.
- **`components/leaders/verifyState.js` is THE verification vocabulary** —
  states, colours, icons and precedence for the register chip, the page and the
  filter. Never improvise a second set of words for these five facts. Every
  state carries an icon as well as a colour. A day voided by the filing window
  shows only its void chip; no second red mark beside it.

Related memory: `leader-ai-proof-review`, `leader-task-photo-window`,
`leaders-shift1-submission-window`.

## Browser login (the second door)

The app has two front doors into the **same** session. Telegram is the first:
`initData` proves the caller sits in a real WebView and `app/security.py`
re-verifies it on every request. The second is a username + password at
`production.safiacorporate.uz`, for people at a desk.

- **The credential belongs to the PROFILE**, keyed by `identity.profile_key`
  (`web_credentials` table). Several Telegram accounts holding one profile share
  one login, exactly as they share everything else that profile owns.
- **A browser session is not a different identity.** `web_auth.session_identity()`
  resolves the profile to the very same `(telegram_id, role, role_id, role_ref)`
  tuple a Telegram login produces, so page grants, capabilities, factory locks
  and ownership behave identically — nothing to keep in sync. The one difference:
  `roles: []`, because the role-switcher would move the session to a profile the
  password was never issued for.
- **`security.py` accepts exactly ONE thing besides initData**: a JWT carrying
  `web: True`. A Telegram-issued token still cannot be replayed from a browser.
  Because that token is the whole proof, it is checked against the DB on every
  request — a disabled login or a bumped `token_version` dies immediately.
- **A browser can hold SEVERAL sessions at once** — the profile wallet
  (`utils/profileWallet.js`). The header menu's «Yangi profil qo'shish» asks for
  another profile's username + password (Telegram still deep-links the bot's
  register flow), and that profile joins the menu beside the current one instead
  of replacing it; tapping a row swaps the active token, no password. Only the
  JWT is stored, never the password, and each row keeps its OWN «remember me»:
  ticked → localStorage, unticked → sessionStorage, mirroring `session.js` so a
  colleague added for one shift is gone when the tab closes. A switch VALIDATES
  the stored token against `/api/auth/web/session` before committing and puts the
  old one back if it is dead (expired, `token_version` bumped), then re-asks that
  profile's password — a row is never silently dropped. «Chiqish» signs out of
  the ACTIVE profile only and falls back to the next row; the login screen is
  only for the last one. Switching always does a full page load: per-page
  filters, scroll and fetched rows belong to the profile being left.
- **`token_version` is the revocation handle.** Bump it to end every browser
  session for a profile (password change, reset, disable, rename, admin
  "sign out everywhere"). Telegram sessions never carry it.
- Passwords are PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 from the stdlib (`web_auth.hash_password`) —
  deliberately no native dependency on a pipeline that deploys straight to prod.
  5 failed attempts → 15-minute lockout, DB-backed; the per-IP throttle is
  in-process and deliberately secondary.
- **A new password is DELIVERED only to Telegram.** `web_auth.dm_credentials()`
  DMs every holder of the profile, and no create/reset/bulk response carries it
  back. A profile with no approved holder therefore gets no login — the admin UI
  says so rather than offering one that could not be delivered.
- **An admin can READ an existing password back** on the profile page — the
  «Sayt logini» card shows the login and the password, both copyable, the
  password masked until the eye is tapped. This needs the password to be
  recoverable, so `WebCredential` carries `password_enc` beside the hash: the
  same secret sealed with `web_auth.seal_password` (HMAC-SHA256 encrypt-then-MAC,
  stdlib only, key derived from `SECRET_KEY` — which lives in `backend/.env` and
  never in the DB, so a dbdump `.sql.gz` is ciphertext). `web_auth.set_password`
  is THE writer: it sets hash + sealed copy + `password_set_at` together, and
  every path that changes a password (admin create/reset/bulk, self-change,
  «forgot password») goes through it — a writer that sets only the hash makes
  the panel show a password that no longer logs in. Rows predating the column
  read as «unknown»; nothing is ever guessed.
  `POST /api/profiles/admin/web-login/reveal` returns it for ONE profile, is
  **admin-only** (narrower than the rest of the tab, which `admin.profiles.manage`
  grantees may run — every other action changes a login and is therefore visible
  to its owner; reading one is not), and is audited under `WEB-LOGIN revealed`.
  Never add the password to `/admin/list` or any other bulk payload.
- Admin surface: the **Profiles tab** (`pages/admin/WebLoginModal.jsx`) — a
  «Sayt logini» column plus one row action for create / reset / rename /
  disable / sign-out-everywhere / delete, and a bulk «create for everyone
  without one» scoped to the rows currently visible. Usernames are derived as
  `surname.initial` (`aripova.m`), widening to `surname.firstname` then a numeric
  suffix. `_deny_admin_profile` still applies: a capability grantee may never
  mint a browser password for an ADMIN profile.
- Self-service: Settings → «Change password» (browser sessions only), and
  «Forgot password» on the login screen, which DMs a fresh password and always
  answers identically so it cannot be used as a membership oracle.
- Registration stays Telegram-only — it needs the bot to sign the profile claim.
  `/login` redirects to `/` outside Telegram.
- Audit: every change greps out of `backend/logs/app.log` under `WEB-LOGIN`
  (sign-in, self-reset, self-change, and each admin action with actor + target).
  Passwords never appear in it.
- **Excel exports now branch on the surface**: a browser session downloads the
  file, Telegram still DMs it. One decision point each side —
  `app/xlsx_delivery.py` and `utils/exportXlsx.js` — never re-derived per page.
  This supersedes the older "exports always go to the chat" rule for browsers.
- Telegram-only chrome (expand, fullscreen, safe-area insets) is gated on
  `utils/session.js` `inTelegram()`, which tests `WebApp.platform !== "unknown"`
  — `window.Telegram.WebApp` exists in every browser and proves nothing.

## Workflow

- **`gitea` is THE remote** — `git.safiabakery.uz/Safia-Outsource/production` (private). `main` tracks `gitea/main`, so a bare `git pull` / `git push` means gitea. GitHub (`origin`) is a mirror only: it is pushed last, best-effort, and never gated on.
- **Pushing to `main` deploys to production.** `.gitea/workflows/deploy.yaml` runs `deploy/deploy.sh` on the VPS on every push — see the Deployment section below.
- **The whole loop is automated by two hooks in `.claude/settings.local.json`: pull → edit → build → commit → push.**
  - `SessionStart` → `.claude/hooks/auto-pull.sh` fetches gitea and **fast-forwards `main`** before anything is edited. It never merges or rebases: on a diverged branch, or when uncommitted work blocks the fast-forward, it reports and leaves the tree untouched. Log: `.claude/auto-pull.log`.
  - `Stop` → `.claude/hooks/auto-commit.sh` bumps `VERSION` (patch, unless the turn already set it — see Versioning), runs the Vite build, commits everything with a generated message, then pushes **gitea first** (that is the deploy) and the GitHub mirror after. A failed build aborts the commit; a failed mirror push is cosmetic and says so; a failed *gitea* push says `NOT deployed`. Log: `.claude/auto-commit.log`.
  - Net effect: **one turn = one commit = one production deploy**, with no staging step and no review window. Verify a doubtful build by hand with `cd frontend && npx vite build`.
  - The pull only runs at session start. If `main` moves on gitea mid-session the push at turn end is *rejected*, not silently merged — you will see `PUSH FAILED` in the summary; pull and re-run.
- `frontend/dist` is TRACKED and prod serves the SPA from it. Commit the build alongside the source — the pipeline rebuilds it for you if you forget, but committing it makes the deploy a no-restart, zero-downtime file swap.
- Backend changes need a service restart on prod (systemd `safia-production`, uvicorn — the cPanel/Passenger host is gone). The pipeline restarts automatically for `backend/**` and `bot/**`. Startup migrations still go in BOTH the FastAPI lifespan and `passenger_wsgi.py`, even though only the lifespan executes today.
- i18n: 4 languages (uz / uz_cyrl / ru / en). Static UI text via `t()` keys added to all 4; DB text via `tl()` transliteration.

## Deployment

Push to `main` → `https://production.safiacorporate.uz` updates itself. No
manual step, no SSH.

- **Where**: `user@185.74.5.198`, code at `/var/www/production` (a checkout of
  this repo), systemd unit `safia-production` on `127.0.0.1:8030`, nginx in
  front. The Gitea act_runner runs ON that same host as the same user, so the
  job needs no SSH hop and carries no secrets; the checkout reads the repo with
  a read-only deploy key.
- **What it does** (`deploy/deploy.sh`): `backend/**`, `bot/**`, the unit file
  → restart · `requirements.txt` → pip install + restart · frontend sources
  with no rebuilt `frontend/dist` in the same commit → `npm ci` + Vite build ·
  `frontend/dist` alone → nothing but the checkout, and the new UI is live
  immediately.
- **If it goes wrong**: an unhealthy `/health` after restart rolls the checkout
  back to the previous commit, restarts, and fails the job. Watch a deploy in
  the repo's Actions tab, or `journalctl -u safia-production -f` on the box.
- **Never edit files directly on the server** — the next deploy hard-resets the
  checkout. Server-only state (`backend/.env`, the Google service-account key,
  the venv) is untracked and survives; everything else comes from git.
- Run a deploy by hand with `bash /var/www/production/deploy/deploy.sh`, or
  force a restart with `FORCE_RESTART=1 bash …` (also available as
  "Run workflow" in the Actions tab).
- Secrets never belong in the repo. `backend/.env` is provisioned on the server
  and stays untracked. `.gitignore` ignores `*.json` wholesale behind a short
  allow-list (`package.json`, the lockfile, tsconfig/jsconfig/eslint config), so
  if you add a file the app must read at runtime, check
  `git check-ignore -v <path>` before assuming it shipped.

## Versioning

The repo-root `VERSION` file is the ONE source of truth — `frontend/vite.config.js`
injects it into the bundle, `backend/app/version.py` reads it for
`FastAPI(version=…)` and `/api/version`. Never add a second one; `package.json`
stays `0.0.0` on purpose.

**Every change bumps `VERSION`, sized to its impact** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), and
a bump RESETS every number to its right to 0 — `1.4.7` → patch `1.4.8` → minor
`1.5.0` → major `2.0.0`. What each level means here:

| Level | Bump for | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **PATCH** `1.0.x` | Nothing new; something works better | bug fix, copy/translation fix, styling or spacing tweak, refactor with no visible change, docs |
| **MINOR** `1.x.0` | Something the user can now do, or a visible behaviour change | new page/tab/admin destination, new endpoint or capability, a new column/filter/export, a template gaining a prop |
| **MAJOR** `x.0.0` | The app is no longer used the way it was | data-model migration, auth/permission model change, a page removed or replaced, a redesign of a core flow. Rare — reserved. |

**PATCH is AUTOMATIC — never hand-bump one.** `.claude/hooks/auto-commit.sh`
bumps the patch digit on every commit it makes, before the build (Vite bakes
`VERSION` into the bundle, so a later bump would ship a bundle claiming the old
number). Nothing to remember, and no deploy can go out unversioned.

**MINOR and MAJOR are the judgement the hook cannot make — express one by
EDITING `VERSION` during the turn.** A `VERSION` already changed against `HEAD`
is left strictly alone by the hook, so your number is what ships. That is the
whole mechanism: edit it for a big change, ignore it for a small one. There is
no marker file and no flag.

- **One turn = one commit = one deploy = at most ONE bump.** Never per file.
- **Mixed turn → the highest level wins.** A feature plus three fixes is one
  MINOR, not a MINOR and three PATCHes — so edit `VERSION` once, to `x.(y+1).0`.
- **A turn that edits no shipped code doesn't bump** — the hook exits before the
  bump when the tree is clean, so questions and investigations cost nothing.
- The version leads the commit subject (`v1.2.0: Update Sidebar.jsx …`), which
  makes `git log --oneline` the release history. `VERSION` itself is excluded
  from the message generator's diff — it changes every commit and says nothing
  about what any one of them did.

Three readings, deliberately distinct, all in the sidebar's «Versiya» dialog
(`components/layout/VersionBadge.jsx`): **App** = the bundle this tab is
running · **Deployed** = the bundle a reload would give it · **Server** = the
Python process, its checkout commit and its boot time. A commit newer than the
boot time means a backend change is still waiting on a restart — a
frontend-only deploy never triggers one.

- **A browser versions by the asset hash, not by this number.** Vite's
  content-hashed filenames plus `/assets/* immutable` and `index.html no-store`
  in `main.py` are the whole cache story; the version string is a human label
  and changes nothing about caching.
- **Update detection compares the BUILD STAMP, not the version.** Even with the
  bump rule above, the version is the wrong handle: it is set by judgement and
  a rebuild can ship the same number twice, while the stamp is unique per build.
  `dist/build.json` is written by the build (and served **no-store**, same
  reason as `index.html`); `hooks/useAppUpdate.js` polls it every 5 min and on
  window focus, and `UpdatePrompt` in `Layout` offers a reload. It NEVER
  reloads by itself — attendance drafts, admin forms and half-typed comments
  are all unsaved state. The reactive half of the same problem stays
  `lazyWithReload` → `window.__staleReload` (a lazy chunk that 404s), which
  fires only once the app is already broken.
- `dist/build.json` survives the wholesale `*.json` ignore via an explicit `!`
  line in `.gitignore`. Ignored, it never ships and the prompt goes silent.
- Vite 8 runs Rolldown, which silently dropped `this.emitFile` in
  `generateBundle` — the plugin writes the marker in `writeBundle` instead.

## Context discipline

- Read only the files needed for the task. Don't sweep the tree or open files "to understand the codebase" — this document is the map. Use the UI-template table above to find the right component instead of grepping for it.
- When the user names a file or component, edit that one. Follow imports/types only as far as needed to make the edit correct, not to survey the project.
- Prefer targeted `Grep` for a specific symbol over reading whole files. Read the minimal region of a large file, not the entire file.
- If you think you need to read beyond the files the user named, ask first (one line) rather than exploring on your own.
- Reading a file immediately before editing it is expected and fine — the goal is to cut *exploratory* reads, not necessary ones.
